Use the document-commit-push-pr skill (located at skills/document-commit-push-pr/SKILL.md) and complete the entire shipping process.

Execute the following slash commands in sequence, waiting for each to complete before running the next:

1. Run `/document` - Document project progress
2. Run `/commit` - Stage, commit, and push all changes
3. Run `/pr` - Create a new PR or update an existing one

Report the final PR URL when complete.
